# Playwright TypeScript Init - Direct Playwright Report Access

## GitHub Pages Configuration for Direct HTML Report Access

This repository is configured to automatically deploy the latest Playwright HTML report directly to GitHub Pages. When you visit the GitHub Pages URL, you'll immediately see the Playwright test report without any landing page or fallback pages.

### 🚀 What's Configured

1. **Direct Report Access**: The GitHub Pages URL opens directly to the Playwright HTML report
2. **Automated Deployment**: Reports are automatically deployed after:
   - Sanity Tests (every 2 hours)
   - Nightly Regression Tests (daily at 2 AM UTC)
3. **Latest Report**: Always shows the most recent test execution results
4. **Clean Failure**: If no reports are available, the deployment simply logs errors without creating fallback HTML pages

### 📊 Report Access

- **Direct Report**: https://netanelh2.github.io/Playwright-TypeScript-Init/
- **No Landing Page**: Immediate access to the Playwright HTML report interface
- **No Fallback Pages**: Clean failure with log messages only when reports are unavailable

**Note**: Code Quality workflows focus on development standards (linting, formatting, TypeScript) and do not generate HTML reports.

### 📋 Setup Requirements

To enable this functionality, the repository administrator needs to:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Ensure the repository has GitHub Pages enabled

2. **Required Permissions**:
   - The workflows have the necessary permissions configured
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically has the required access

3. **Repository Secrets**:
   - Ensure `BASE_URL` repository secret is configured for test execution
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add `BASE_URL` as a repository secret (not organization-level)

### 🔧 Workflow Files Created/Modified

1. **Modified File**: `.github/workflows/disabled_deploy-reports.yml`
   - Handles automatic deployment of Playwright HTML report directly to GitHub Pages root
   - Triggers after test workflows complete
   - Deploys the latest report without any custom landing page or fallback HTML pages
   - Clean failure handling with console messages only

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `disabled_sanity.yml` - Enhanced with report deployment links
   - `disabled_nightly-regression.yml` - Enhanced with report deployment links
   - `code-quality.yml` - Maintained as development-focused quality gate

### 📊 Report Features

- **Direct Access**: GitHub Pages URL opens directly to Playwright report (no intermediate pages)
- **Latest Results**: Always shows the most recent test execution
- **Native Playwright UI**: Full access to Playwright's built-in report interface
- **Interactive Features**: Trace viewing, test filtering, and detailed test results
- **Automatic Updates**: Report updates automatically after each test run
- **Clean Failures**: When reports are unavailable, only console error messages are shown
- **Stakeholder Ready**: Clean, professional interface suitable for all audiences

### 🛠 Manual Deployment

You can also manually trigger report deployment:

1. Go to Actions → "Deploy Playwright HTML Report to GitHub Pages"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select which test workflow's reports to deploy (sanity or regression)
4. Click "Run workflow"

### 📱 Accessing Reports

Once deployed, the Playwright HTML report will be directly available at:

- **Direct Report**: `https://netanelh2.github.io/Playwright-TypeScript-Init/`

No additional navigation needed - the URL opens directly to the Playwright report interface.

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

If reports aren't appearing:

1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
2. Verify that the workflows completed successfully
3. Ensure artifacts were uploaded properly
4. Check the "Deploy Playwright HTML Report" workflow logs for error messages
5. If no reports are found, the deployment will simply log error messages without creating placeholder pages

### 🚨 Error Handling

When reports cannot be deployed:

- **Console Messages**: Clear error messages in workflow logs explaining the issue
- **No Fallback Pages**: No placeholder HTML pages are created
- **Common Causes**: GitHub storage quota exceeded, missing artifacts, or retention period expired
- **Resolution**: Reports will auto-deploy once the underlying issue is resolved

**Note**: The first deployment may take a few minutes to become available after enabling GitHub Pages. Once deployed, the GitHub Pages URL will open directly to the Playwright HTML report without any intermediate landing page.
